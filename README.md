# Time Series & Mobility Analysis (Python)

This repository contains my Python work on **time-series** and **mobility/trajectory** data analysis.
The focus is on cleaning raw traces, extracting useful features, and analyzing patterns over time.

## Files
- `Ts.ipynb`
  - Data loading and preprocessing of mobility traces
  - Time-based cleaning (timestamps, missing values, ordering)
  - Exploratory analysis and visualizations

- `Ts2.ipynb`
  - Advanced mobility analytics (trajectory patterns, statistics, comparisons)
  - Feature extraction (e.g., speed/distance/time windows depending on the dataset)
  - Additional plots and summary insights

## Skills demonstrated
- Time-series preprocessing (resampling, filtering, windowing)
- Mobility trace cleaning and trajectory handling
- Feature extraction + descriptive analytics
- Visualization and interpretation of mobility behavior
